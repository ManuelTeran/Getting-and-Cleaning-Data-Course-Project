=================

DATA SET ONE
=================
The table x.out contain de meerge betwen the train files and the test files with the descriptive labels

The x.out file has the next vairables:

type (indicate if the observation is train or test type)
sibject ( indicate the subject)
activity ( inducate the the type of the activite)

and the next varaiables in mean() and std()

tBodyAcc-XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

The x.out data set contain 10299 obs. and 82 variables.


DATA SET TWO
